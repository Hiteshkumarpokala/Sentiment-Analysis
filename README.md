
# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis** using two approaches:

1. **Web-based Implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript + Streamlit UI)**  
   - A simple interactive interface to analyze text sentiment.  
   - Allows both single text analysis and bulk CSV file upload for batch sentiment analysis.

2. **Python-based Implementation**  
   - Uses Python libraries (`re`, `json`, `typing`) for advanced text sentiment classification.  
   - Easily extendable for more complex NLP tasks.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Single Analysis**: Enter a text snippet and instantly classify it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.  
- **Bulk Analysis**: Upload a CSV file containing text column(s) for large-scale sentiment analysis.  
- **Web-based Dashboard**: Clean UI using **Streamlit + HTML/CSS/JS**.  
- **Lightweight Python Backend**: Handles text cleaning and sentiment detection.  
- **Exportable Results**: After bulk analysis, results can be exported.

## ðŸ›  Project Requirements

To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need:

- **Python 3.10+**  
  [Download Python 3.10 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Virtual Environment (recommended)**  

**Python Libraries:**

```bash
streamlit
pandas
re
json
typing
````

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“‚ Database / Data Setup

No heavy database is required for this project.

* **Single Text Analysis:** Input is processed directly.
* **Bulk Analysis:** Upload a CSV file with at least one column containing text data.

**Example CSV format:**

```csv
id,text
1,This product is amazing!
2,I'm not happy with the service.
3,It was okay, nothing special.
```

## ðŸ’» How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd Sentiment-Analysis
```

2. **Create & Activate Virtual Environment**

* **Windows**

```bash
py -3.10 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Mac/Linux**

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**

Make sure you are in the project root folder where `sentiment_app.py` is located:

```bash
streamlit run sentiment_app.py
```

5. **Open in Browser**

Streamlit will give a local URL, usually:

ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## ðŸ“¸ Outputs

* **Single Analysis:** Enter a sentence â†’ click **Predict** â†’ sentiment displayed.
* **Bulk Analysis:** Upload CSV â†’ see sentiment classification table + chart instantly.

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

* Use Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, LSTM, Transformers).
* Add **Sentiment Intensity Score** instead of just Positive/Negative/Neutral.
* Add **Multi-language Support**.
